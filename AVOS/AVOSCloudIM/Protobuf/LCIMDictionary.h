// naming of the method might be things like "-valueForKey:",
// "-setValue:forKey:"; etc. But those selectors are also defined by Key Value
// Coding (KVC) as categories on NSObject. So "overloading" the selectors with
// other meanings can cause warnings (based on compiler settings), but more
// importantly, some of those selector get called as KVC breaks up keypaths.
// So if those selectors are used, using KVC will compile cleanly, but could
// crash as it invokes those selectors with the wrong types of arguments.
